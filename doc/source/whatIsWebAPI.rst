An application-programming interface (API) is a set of programming instructions and standards for accessing a Web-based software application or Web tool. 
Software companies often  release their APIs to the public so that other software developers can design products that are powered by their service.
For example, Amazon.com released its API so that Web site developers could more easily access Amazon's product information. Using the Amazon API, a 
third party Web site can post direct links to Amazon products with updated prices and an option to "buy now."

An API is a software-to-software interface, not a user interface. With APIs, applications talk to each other without any user knowledge or intervention. 
When you buy movie tickets online and enter your credit card information, the movie ticket Web site uses an API to send your credit card information to 
a remote application that verifies whether your information is correct. Once payment is confirmed, the remote application sends a response back to the movie 
ticket Web site saying it's OK to issue the tickets.

APIs allow a software application to communicate with a remote application over the Internet through a series of calls. These calls are managed through a web
service protocol (usually SOAP or ReST) that deals with the details of data exchange.

An API is, by definition, an interface, something that defines the way in which two entities communicate. 
This means that it's platform independent - this is why you can send requests to a Linux server from a Windows machine.
The API itself is a chunk of software code written as a series of messages. 
Each message corresponds to a different function of the remote service. For example (...)

APIs and Web service protocols are completely invisible to Web site surfers and software users. 
Their job is to run silently in the background, providing a way for applications to work with each other to get the users the information or functionality they need.

Software developers use web APIs by programming new or existing software to generate the right messages to tap the power of remote applications. 
Let's take conference scheduling, for example. With the right code, the developer could build conference-scheduling functionality into the company's 
existing e-mail system. Or, perhaps she could develop an entirely new instant messaging application that has one-click instant audio conferences.
