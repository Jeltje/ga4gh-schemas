The `Data Working Group <http://ga4gh.org/#/>`_ of the
`Global Alliance for Genomics and Health <http://genomicsandhealth.org/>`_
has defined an
`API <http://ga4gh.org/documentation/api/v0.5.1/ga4gh_api.html#/>`_
to facilitate interoperable exchange of genomic data.
This is the the documentation for the API schemas.

**Some basic terms**

**The GA4GH API**
    An application programming interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. 
    An API expresses a software component in terms of its operations, inputs, outputs, and underlying types.

**What is a schema?**
    The main goal of the API schemas is  to provide abstract, mathematically complete and precise models 
    of the data that is manipulated by the GA4GH API.
