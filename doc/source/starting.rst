  * Create a  tutorial leads a developer step-by-step through the process of creating a simple application that demonstrates how the API works. 
	- Start with non-programming activities, such as setting up your development environment or obtaining authorization credentials. 
        - Then direct the developer to gradually add code until they can demonstrate a simple task from the API. 
        - Structure the tutorial so that developers have something they can run and see results quickly. 
	- Then add more features.
